Death silently crept along the preternaturally enshadowed edge of Mill Creek the way only nocturnal creatures of prey dream. He had embarked toward a ghastly affair, the Wedding for the Dead. Death was to preside over an unholy union, fulfilling a promise he made over a century ago. An erroneous pact he would conduct tonight with reprisal.

Time passes. A lurid colorful leaf eerily drifts to the ground from an on high ghostly branch of a deciduous birch. The last time this ominous grim reaper had spent any lingering spell in Erie, Pennsylvania was some 196 shuddersome years ago. It took quite some time to extend the cadaverous hand of necrosis to gather all the lost souls cast off by the Battle of Lake Erie.

Sure, Death has been around a moment or two, here and there, to embrace the dearly departed over the years. He even took some pleasure at the Pennsylvanian conservative superstitious view of death. How they feared his macabre presence and shivered when he entered the room to complete his unearthly task. Tonight Death has a more unusual undertaking; a loathsome interval intermixed with a millennia soul harvesting.

The Wedding for the Dead was to take place this autumn. Autumn, the waning period of the life cycle; so full of decay, death, and brilliantly warm analogous beauty. At no place on Earth are peak fall colors more beautiful than Pennsylvania. Even Death took the time to admire the spectacular Appalachian flora in its seasonal circumstance. A striking phenomenon leaving the countryside an ocean of various shades of reds, yellows, oranges, with hints of purple, black, magenta, blue and brown.

Even as far back as September 10th, 1813 Death remembered the unseasonably early development of red anthocyanin pigments & cyclical metamorphosis had begun to show and the crisp bouquet of winter was in the air. Misery Bay was cradled in seasonal allure as the crown jewel of Presque Isle. The U. S. S. Lawrence sunk to the bottom of Misery Bay dragging four-fifths of its 40 crew members to a shallow watery grave; a stark adulation to the grim reality of the scarecrows lament.
