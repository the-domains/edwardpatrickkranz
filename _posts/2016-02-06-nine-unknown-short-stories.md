In writing my Steampunk novels, Secret Society of the Nine Unknown Men and Cowpunks Steamangels, I determined that further definition of the mystique surrounding the ancient Indian myth/legend that is Emperor Ashoka's Secret Society of the Nine Unknown Men. Nine Unknown Short Stories is my exercise to explore and define who and what the oldest secret society is about. The nine short stories will take us through adventures starting in antediluvian times, moving to Ancient India and encounters with Emperor Ashoka in 260 BC, centering on Victorian England and America, and culminating in the 21st century. I will start writing the Nine Unknown Short Stories starting New Year's Day 2012\.
