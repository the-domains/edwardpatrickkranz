Late Night Drip 2005

Sysco Coffee on Ampersand Textured

I've attended collage 3 times now
over the past 3 decades. The first time was Penn State Behrend campus near my
home town of Erie, Pa. This would be right after graduation 1987\. At
the end of the first year I still had no idea what I wanted to do and they did
not have an art major at that satellite campus. I was a few credits shy of
graduating with my AA in Computer Animation from the Art Institute of Seattle
10 years later but experienced a house fire and a string of events that could
only be described in the sadist of country songs.The third round started in 2010 at the Art
Institute of Pittsburgh in their Media Arts and Design Bachelor program. Third
times a charm they say!

I can remember late nights at
assorted cafes studying for the onslaught the next day.
