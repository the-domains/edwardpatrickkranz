Let's talk about what is going right with the Grid. It is fairly intuitive. After a few minutes of dinking around, yes, that is a technical term, I was able to create 6 separate Websites, add content from my computer, capture content from other Websites including YouTube, and watch the videos on my new sites.
Creating the top level navigation was fairly simple as was pinning or highlighting certain articles to the top.
Choosing a layout, typeface, and other design elements such as color palette was also something a novice could grasp and execute within minutes of experimenting.
Metadata level information on pages and images took a bit longer to find, but again, not very hard to work once they were discovered and experimented with for a few minutes. 
Images look fantastic and the crop, layer, filter/overlay options give a bit of control to the layout and design aspect of the site.
Once the site is generated it loads fairly quickly.
Before I get into some of what is not working; is there a list of features you will be releasing in the foreseeable future? This might help out with what your Beta testers are struggling with. Please publish the features you will be adding in 2016 and the ones you plan to add in 2017\. Communication is much better than letting us guess and become frustrated at the lack of CMS features one would expect from a 21st century Website.
Some concepts that are not working. There is no way to set the priority of a pinned or highlighted article or any of the articles. There is no way to have multiple content items or articles under a page linked via the main navigation. There is also no way to have a sub-navigation either. All information has to flow in one long long article. Not really good user interface design.
For example, I am an artist, a write, and a book binder. My main navigation on my "Index" page has a link for each that will take you to a page. If you click on The Art link and go to that page, I would like to have a sub-menu for Watercolor, Oils, Sketches, and Encaustic. I would also like to have multiple content articles under each link. I wouldn't want my watercolor shows, portfolios, tutorials mixed in with the sketches or Encaustics. This is my biggest issue. Without being able to organize my content this become nothing more than an online brochure. Not very AI worthy if you ask me.
Any chance that a sub-navigation will be added and the ability to post multiple contents to a linked page as you can with the main page?
I would like to be able to drag the content tiles around and put them in a hierarchy or drag them to another site in my Grid dashboard. Having the ability to set priority on which articles load first is valuable. 
There is no way to set the order of the main navigation. 
I do not see a bin folder where I can drop documents such as PDFs to link to. If I want a PDF that lives on my computer accessible on my Website I have to host it someplace else to link to it. That does not make very good content management sense to me. Same goes with videos that are not hosted on YouTube or another site. If I have something that lives on my computer and nowhere on the Web I cannot link it or upload it to my site.
Buttons to share content via social media should be a feature.
Being able to add my own logo to my site would be good for my brand recognition.
Analytical data on how many, who, from what regions, and navigation path would be helpful in the future as well.
E-commerce is a must but I can see there is work before you are ready for that.
Having a feed from our Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites seems to be necessary in this day and age.
After writing a document in Word or other program one might want to paste the document into a page. With the current setup a 20 paragraph article or story becomes one big block of text that then needs to be reformatted wasting time.
I can't say that I see true AI at work. The sliders seem to be preset layouts that the site owner chooses...not really the AI doing the design work. Site owner also chooses the fonts, rhythmic contrast, and color scheme for the most part. I threw 22 articles at my main site. I am playing with text, images, video, and content from other sites. There were other articles that I had posted and removed during experimentation. 
Don't get me wrong, impressive programing but not sure I am buying the AI aspect of the design process. Maybe as the Grid evolves it will become more evident but so far I think it is me who is choosing the limited number of blocky layouts. I am not too worried about this part at the moment. If I cannot arrange the content in a meaningful and useful way then the rest of the design is irrelevant.
I feel that the current number of layouts is limited. I'm sure that more options are on the horizon and that the AI will develop a sense of design and start laying out the sites with a little more variation...so they don't all look so similar.
