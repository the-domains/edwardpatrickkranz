# Secret Society of the Nine Unknown Men;  A Steampunk Pope Chronicle by Edward Patrick Ezju Kranz.

Secret Society of the Nine Unknown Men is the first in a series of novellas in the Steam Punk Pope Chronicles. This series will outline the clandestine role of the Papacy in world affairs in a Science Fiction, secret service, superheroesque world filled with advanced ancient civilizations, Victorian Dress, enigmatic artifacts, Enlightened Priest-Kings, Atlantean airships, and a history of the Bible only the Pope and his Guru are privy to.

The story opens with Pope Pius IX as he looks down from the rafters at Ford's Theater on the dyeing President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, with the sinking realization that he has failed for the first time since he has become Pope. Why was the Pope at Ford's Theater? Why would he want to save an American President? Who was he trying to save Lincoln from? How does this assassination tie in with Ancient Egypt, a beautiful prostitute from the London Underworld, and Secret Society of the Nine Unknown Men? Check back for story and art developments!

Secret Society of the Nine Unknown Men will be self-published simultaneously as a hardcover novella and a graphic novel on March 23, 2013\. This series is written by the artist and author, Edward Patrick Ezju Kranz with research and contributions from his loving & beautiful wife and partner Antonyia Kranz as well as from a good friend, Lane Edwards.
