How did it happen? I haven't a clue. I once asked the brilliantly esteemed Stephen Hawking about my condition and an hour before I asked, in his synthesized voice, he told me, "...it was preposterously improbable even in a quantum universe with an infinite number of possibilities. You are just a silly person." It must be after the Spring Equinox. 

The Funny thing is, my issue, whatever it is or, however, impossible it may seem, it doesn't even directly coincide with Day Light Savings Time. This year spring forward fell on March 13th at 2:00 AM. I fell one hour in the past on March 19th at 9:30 AM. I didn't even have a powerful Soothsayer to forebode my own personal Ides of March, which incidentally fell on March 15\. Today is my birthday, March 23rd. 

At first, it was fun. After the Fall Equinox I would arrive on time, an hour early, and set-up practical jokes and gags in the office. I clearly already knew who was going to be where in the next hour, since I lived one hour in the future, so it was easy. During those months, before the Spring Equinox, I was very persuasive in the meeting rooms. It was like I was clairvoyant.

I could sleep in an hour, arrive late, and be on time. One evening I sat down in my favorite chair after getting ready for a party. I closed my eyes and watched the party as it unfolded for the first hour. It wasn't until Bob asked, "Hey! Where is the joker?"

Julie shouted above the music, "No idea, he's usually on time. Maybe he got hit by a bus or something?"

It was then that it hit me! I wasn't there! I slept through the past and didn't arrive when I should have in the future! I woke with my heart in my throat. My pulse raced at 134 BPM. Did I just die and I haven't caught up with that time yet?

"There he is! The life of the party!" the room resounded! 

Nope. I didn't die. I just fell asleep and arrived a half-hour late! That was a close one! No more sleeping in in the future!

I remember the last Fall Equinox quite clearly. It was the first time I had to live one hour in the past. I was always playing catch up. 

Today, March 23rd, 2016 I have this to say to you, "I greet you, people of the past, your ways are quaint."
