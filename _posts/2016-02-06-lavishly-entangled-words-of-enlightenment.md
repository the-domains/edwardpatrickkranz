Speculative & Autobiographical Fiction . . . Things remembered, things forgotten, odd history bits, relationships, Sociopaths and sex, Halloween and death and weddings, time, cults, friends, possessed hands, and other events in my life mixed with fantasy.

Most of the stories have some basis in fact and experience but while writing imagination takes over and elements of fantasy and fiction enter into the stories.
