<p>Death silently crept along the preternaturally enshadowed edge of Mill Creek the way only nocturnal creatures of prey dream. He had embarked toward a ghastly affair, the Wedding for the Dead. Death was to preside over an unholy union, fulfilling a promise he made over a century ago. An erroneous pact he would conduct tonight with reprisal.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1cb39883-6411-432e-bb1b-a04c88ccbc94.jpg"><p>Time passes. A lurid colorful leaf eerily drifts to the ground from an on high ghostly branch of a deciduous birch.  The last time this ominous grim reaper had spent any lingering spell in Erie, Pennsylvania was some 196 shuddersome years ago. It took quite some time to extend the cadaverous hand of necrosis to gather all the lost souls cast off by the Battle of Lake Erie.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f6d3df72-dbc4-4752-abf0-66bcf25638d1.jpg"><p>Sure, Death has been around a moment or two, here and there, to embrace the dearly departed over the years. He even took some pleasure at the Pennsylvanian conservative superstitious view of death. How they feared his macabre presence and shivered when he entered the room to complete his unearthly task. Tonight Death has a more unusual undertaking; a loathsome interval intermixed with a millennia soul harvesting.</p><p>The Wedding for the Dead was to take place this autumn. Autumn, the waning period of the life cycle; so full of decay, death, and brilliantly warm analogous beauty. At no place on Earth are peak fall colors more beautiful than Pennsylvania. Even Death took the time to admire the spectacular Appalachian flora in its seasonal circumstance. A striking phenomenon leaving the countryside an ocean of various shades of reds, yellows, oranges, with hints of purple, black, magenta, blue and brown.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8501e117-1873-4709-8f4c-f26f729ffeba.jpg"><p>Even as far back as September 10th, 1813 Death remembered the unseasonably early development of red anthocyanin pigments & cyclical metamorphosis had begun to show and the crisp bouquet of winter was in the air. Misery Bay was cradled in seasonal allure as the crown jewel of Presque Isle. The U. S. S. Lawrence sunk to the bottom of Misery Bay dragging four-fifths of its 40 crew members to a shallow watery grave; a stark adulation to the grim reality of the scarecrows lament.</p><p>Historians had written this gruesome occurrence one way. Death has no political agenda to his haunting memory. His recollection was pure, sociopathic by nature. His memory was written in blood. The dead; disturbingly peaceful, decaying, ghastly in appearance. The wretched souls without closure, without mortal coils, the making of ghosts, the making of poltergeists, restless for Earthly amenity, disembodied spirits death ushered on with undying ghoulish vigilance. Pure. Simple. History.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05739c8e-4f47-4a8c-9e27-47ddf873a49c.jpg"><p>Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry hollowly escaped Death's grip that day. He slipped away momentarily, like a soul after death throes, to the US Brig Niagara. For his death rattle, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry led the American fleet to victory over Barclay and his Great Britain's Royal Navy. It wasn't until August 23rd, 1819 that death stealthily caught up with Oliver in Venezuela. Death greeted the Commodore as an old friend. After all it wasn’t very often Death met the same person more than once. It was there, on the cold Orinoco River, that Death snatched Perry's soul from his rotting body, thanks to the help of disease-laden mosquitoes and yellow fever.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="35"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="37"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="38"><span data-reactid="39"><!-- react-empty: 40 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="41"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="42"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="43"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="44"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="45"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
